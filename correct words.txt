must have you dinvilliers my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that been turning over in my mind ever since you feel like criticizing anyone he told me just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had didnt say any more but weve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way and understood that he meant a great deal more than that consequence inclined to reserve all judgements a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person and so it came about that in college was unjustly accused of being a politician because was privy to the secret griefs of wild unknown men of the confidences were unsoughtfrequently have feigned sleep preoccupation or a hostile levity when realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions judgements is a matter of infinite hope am still a little afraid of missing something if forget that as my father snobbishly suggested and snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth after boasting this way of my tolerance come to the admission that it has a limit may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point dont care what its founded on came back from the last autumn felt that wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart the man who gives his name to this book was exempt from my reactiongatsby who represented everything for which have an unaffected scorn personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures then there was something gorgeous about him some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the creative temperamentit was an extraordinary gift for hope a romantic readiness such as have never found in any other person and which it is not likely shall ever find again turned out all right at the end it is what preyed on what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short winded elations of men family have been prominent well to do people in this city for three generations are something of a clan and we have a tradition that were descended from the of but the actual founder of my line was my grandfathers brother who came here in fifty one sent a substitute to the and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today never saw this great uncle but supposed to look like himwith special reference to the rather hard boiled painting that hangs in fathers office graduated from in just a quarter of a century after my father and a little later participated in that delayed migration known as the enjoyed the counter raid so thoroughly that came back restless of being the warm centre of the world the now seemed like the ragged edge of the universeso decided to go and learn the bond business knew was in the bond business so supposed it could support one more single man my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me and finally said es with very grave hesitant faces agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays came permanently thought in the spring of twenty two practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea found the house a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month but at the last minute the firm ordered him to and went out to the country alone had a dogat least had him for a few days until he ran awayand an old and a woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered wisdom to herself over the electric stove was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man more recently arrived than stopped me on the road do you get to village he asked helplessly told him as walked on was lonely no longer was a guide a pathfinder an original settler had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees just as things grow in fast movies had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath giving air bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint promising to unfold the shining secrets that only and and knew had the high intention of reading many other books besides was rather literary in collegeone year wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the now was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists the well rounded man isnt just an epigramlife is much more successfully looked at from a single window after all was a matter of chance that should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of where there are among other natural curiosities two unusual formations of land miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the hemisphere the great wet barnyard of are not perfect ovalslike the egg in the story they are both crushed flat at the contact endbut their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size lived at thewell the less fashionable of the two though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them house was at the very tip of the egg only fifty yards from the and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season one on my right was a colossal affair by any standardit was a factual imitation of some de in with a tower on one side spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden was mansion rather as didnt know it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name own house was an eyesore but it was a small eyesore and it had been overlooked so had a view of the water a partial view of my neighbours lawn and the consoling proximity of millionairesall for eighty dollars a month the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable glittered along the water and the history of the summer really begins on the evening drove over there to have dinner with the was my second cousin once removed and known in college just after the war spent two days with them in husband among various physical accomplishments had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at national figure in a way one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax family were enormously wealthyeven in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproachbut now hed left and come in a fashion that rather took your breath away for instance hed brought down a string of polo ponies from was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that they came dont know had spent a year in for no particular reason and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together was a permanent move said over the telephone but didnt believe iti had no sight into heart but felt that would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game so it happened that on a warm windy evening drove over to to see two old friends whom scarcely knew at all house was even more elaborate than expected a cheerful red and white mansion overlooking the bay lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardensfinally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run front was broken by a line of windows glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon and in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch had changed since his years he was a sturdy straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that bodyhe seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat was a body capable of enormous leveragea cruel body speaking voice a gruff husky tenor added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed was a touch of paternal contempt in it even toward people he likedand there were men at who had hated his guts dont think my opinion on these matters is final he seemed to say just because stronger and more of a man than you are were in the same senior society and while we were never intimate always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh defiant wistfulness of his own talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch got a nice place here he said his eyes flashing about restlessly me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista including in its sweep a sunken garden a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore belonged to the oil man turned me around again politely and abruptly go inside walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy coloured space fragilely bound into the house by windows at either end windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house breeze blew through the room blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling and then rippled over the wine coloured rug making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall there was a boom as shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor younger of the two was a stranger to me was extended full length at her end of the divan completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of itindeed was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in other girl made an attempt to riseshe leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expressionthen she laughed an absurd charming little laugh and laughed too and came forward into the room p paralysed with happiness laughed again as if she said something very witty and held my hand for a moment looking up into my face promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see was a way she had hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was heard it said that murmur was only to make people lean toward her an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming any rate lips fluttered she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back againthe object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright a sort of apology arose to my lips any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low thrilling voice was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again face was sad and lovely with bright things in it bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget a singing compulsion a whispered a promise that she had done gay exciting things just a while since and that there were gay exciting things hovering in the next hour told her how had stopped off in for a day on my way and how a dozen people had sent their love through me they miss me she cried ecstatically whole town is desolate the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and theres a persistent wail all night along the north shore gorgeous go back she added irrelevantly ought to see the baby like to asleep three years old you ever seen her you ought to see her who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder you doing a bond man with told him heard of them he remarked decisively annoyed me will answered shortly will if you stay in the stay in the dont you worry he said glancing at and then back at me as if he were alert for something more be a damned fool to live anywhere else this point said with such suddenness that startedit was the first word she had uttered since came into the room it surprised her as much as it did me for she yawned and with a series of rapid deft movements stood up into the room stiff she complained been lying on that sofa for as long as can remember look at me retorted been trying to get you to all afternoon thanks said to the four cocktails just in from the pantry absolutely in training host looked at her incredulously are took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass you ever get anything done is beyond me looked at wondering what it was she got done enjoyed looking at her was a slender small breasted girl with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet grey sun strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan charming discontented face occurred to me now that had seen her or a picture of her somewhere before live in she remarked contemptuously know somebody there dont know a single must know demanded could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square languidly their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy coloured porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind candles objected frowning snapped them out with her fingers two weeks itll be the longest day in the year looked at us all radiantly you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it ought to plan something yawned sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed right said we plan turned to me helplessly do people plan could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger she complained hurt it all lookedthe knuckle was black and blue did it she said accusingly know you didnt mean to but you did do it what get for marrying a brute of a man a great big hulking physical specimen of a hate that word hulking objected crossly even in kidding insisted she and talked at once unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire were here and they accepted and me making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away was sharply different from the where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself make me feel uncivilized confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret you talk about crops or something meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way going to pieces broke out violently gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things you read of the by this man no answered rather surprised by his tone its a fine book and everybody ought to read it idea is if we dont look out the white race will bewill be utterly submerged all scientific stuff its been proved getting very profound said with an expression of unthoughtful sadness reads deep books with long words in them was that word we these books are all scientific insisted glancing at her impatiently fellow has worked out the whole thing up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things got to beat them down whispered winking ferociously toward the fervent sun ought to live in began but interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair idea is that were am and you are and you are and an infinitesimal hesitation he included with a slight nod and she winked at me again weve produced all the things that go to make civilizationoh science and art and all that you see was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency more acute than of old was not enough to him any more almost immediately the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me tell you a family secret she whispered enthusiastically about the butlers nose you want to hear about the butlers nose why came over tonight he wasnt always a butler he used to be the silver polisher for some people in that had a silver service for two hundred people had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose went from bad to worse suggested went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as listenedthen the glow faded each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk butler came back and murmured something close to ear whereupon frowned pushed back his chair and without a word went inside if his absence quickened something within her leaned forward again her voice glowing and singing love to see you at my table remind me of aof a rose an absolute rose he turned to for confirmation absolute rose was untrue am not even faintly like a rose was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless thrilling words suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house and exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said in a warning voice subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and leaned forward unashamed trying to hear murmur trembled on the verge of coherence sank down mounted excitedly and then ceased altogether you spoke of is my neighbour began talk want to hear what happens something happening inquired innocently mean to say you dont know said honestly surprised thought everybody knew dont she said hesitantly got some woman in some woman repeated blankly nodded might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time you think before had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and and were back at the table couldnt be helped cried with tense gaiety sat down glanced searchingly at and then at me and continued looked outdoors for a minute and its very romantic outdoors a bird on the lawn that think must be a nightingale come over on the or singing away voice sang romantic isnt it romantic he said and then miserably to me its light enough after dinner want to take you down to the stables telephone rang inside startlingly and as shook her head decisively at the subject of the stables in fact all subjects vanished into air the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table remember the candles being lit again pointlessly and was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone and yet to avoid all eyes couldnt guess what and were thinking but doubt if even who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guests shrill metallic urgency out of mind a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguingmy own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police horses needless to say were not mentioned again and with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf followed around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk saw that turbulent emotions possessed her so asked what thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl dont know each other very well she said suddenly if we are cousins didnt come to my wedding wasnt back from the war true hesitated had a very bad time and pretty cynical about everything she had reason to be waited but she didnt say any more and after a moment returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter suppose she talks andeats and everything yes looked at me absently let me tell you what said when she was born you like to hear much show you how gotten to feel aboutthings she was less than an hour old and was knows where woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl told me it was a girl and so turned my head away and wept right said glad its a girl hope shell be a foolthats the best thing a girl can be in this world a beautiful little fool see think everythings terrible anyhow she went on in a convinced way thinks sothe most advanced people know been everywhere and seen everything and done everything eyes flashed around her in a defiant way rather like and she laughed with thrilling scorn sophisticated instant her voice broke off ceasing to compel my attention my belief felt the basic insincerity of what she had said made me uneasy as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me waited and sure enough in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and belonged the crimson room bloomed with light and sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the words murmurous and uninflected running together in a soothing tune lamplight bright on his boots and dull on the autumn leaf yellow of her hair glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand be continued she said tossing the magazine on the table in our very next issue body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee and she stood up oclock she remarked apparently finding the time on the ceiling for this good girl to go to bed going to play in the tournament tomorrow explained over at knew now why her face was familiarits pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at and and had heard some story of her too a critical unpleasant story but what it was had forgotten long ago night she said softly me at eight wont you youll get up will night you anon course you will confirmed fact think arrange a marriage over often and sort ofohfling you together knowlock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat and all that sort of thing night called from the stairs havent heard a word a nice girl said after a moment oughtnt to let her run around the country this way oughtnt to inquired coldly family family is one aunt about a thousand years old going to look after her arent you going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer think the home influence will be very good for her and looked at each other for a moment in silence she from asked quickly white girlhood was passed together there beautiful white you give a little heart to heart talk on the veranda demanded suddenly looked at me cant seem to remember but think we talked about the race sure we did sort of crept up on us and first thing you know believe everything you hear he advised me said lightly that had heard nothing at all and a few minutes later got up to go home came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light started my motor peremptorily called forgot to ask you something and its important heard you were engaged to a girl out right corroborated kindly heard that you were engaged a libel too poor we heard it insisted surprising me by opening up again in a flower like way heard it from three people so it must be true course knew what they were referring to but wasnt even vaguely engaged fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons had come cant stop going with an old friend on account of rumours and on the other hand had no intention of being rumoured into marriage interest rather touched me and made them less remotely richnevertheless was confused and a little disgusted as drove away seemed to me that the thing for to do was to rush out of the house child in armsbut apparently there were no such intentions in her head for the fact that he had some woman in was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages where new red petrol pumps sat out in pools of light and when reached my estate at ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard wind had blown off leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it saw that was not alonefifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbours mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was himself come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens decided to call to him had mentioned him at dinner and that would do for an introduction didnt call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alonehe stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way and far as was from him could have sworn he was trembling glanced seawardand distinguished nothing except a single green light minute and far away that might have been the end of a dock looked once more for he had vanished and was alone again in the unquiet darkness halfway between and the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land is a valley of ashesa fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally with a transcendent effort of ash grey men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest and immediately the ash grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it you perceive after a moment the eyes of eyes of are blue and gigantictheir retinas are one yard high look out of no face but instead from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away his eyes dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain brood on over the solemn dumping ground valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that first met mistress fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafs with her and leaving her at a table sauntered about chatting with whomsoever he knew was curious to see her had no desire to meet herbut did went up to with on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ash heaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car getting off he insisted want you to meet my girl think hed tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence supercilious assumption was that on afternoon had nothing better to do followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under persistent stare only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land a sort of compact ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all night restaurant approached by a trail of ashes the third was a garagerepairs bought and soldand followed inside interior was unprosperous and bare the only car visible was the dust covered wreck of a which crouched in a dim corner had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office wiping his hands on a piece of waste was a blond spiritless man anaemic and faintly handsome he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes old man said slapping him jovially on the shoulder business cant complain answered unconvincingly are you going to sell me that car week got my man working on it now pretty slow dont he he doesnt said coldly if you feel that way about it maybe better sell it somewhere else after all dont mean that explained quickly just meant voice faded off and glanced impatiently around the garage heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door was in the middle thirties and faintly stout but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can face above a spotted dress of dark blue crpe de chine contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with looking him flush in the eye she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft coarse voice some chairs why dont you so somebody can sit down sure agreed hurriedly and went toward the little office mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinityexcept his wife who moved close to want to see you said intently on the next train right meet you by the newsstand on the lower level nodded and moved away from him just as emerged with two chairs from his office door waited for her down the road and out of sight was a few days before the of and a grey scrawny child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track place isnt it said exchanging a frown with does her good to get away her husband object thinks she goes to see her sister in so dumb he doesnt know hes alive and his girl and went up together to not quite together for sat discreetly in another car deferred that much to the sensibilities of those who might be on the train had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as helped her to the platform in the newsstand she bought a copy of and a moving picture magazine and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one lavender coloured with grey upholstery and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass want to get one of those dogs she said earnestly want to get one for the apartment nice to havea dog backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed kind are they asked eagerly as he came to the taxi window kinds kind do you want lady like to get one of those police dogs dont suppose you got that kind man peered doubtfully into the basket plunged in his hand and drew one up wriggling by the back of the neck no police dog said its not exactly a police dog said the man with disappointment in his voice more of an passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back at that coat coat a dog thatll never bother you with catching cold think its cute said enthusiastically much is it dog looked at it admiringly dog will cost you ten dollars there was an concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly whitechanged hands and settled down into lap where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture it a boy or a girl she asked delicately dog dogs a boy a bitch said decisively your money and buy ten more dogs with it drove over to warm and soft almost pastoral on the summer afternoon wouldnt have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner on said have to leave you here you dont interposed quickly be hurt if you dont come up to the apartment you on she urged telephone my sister said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know like to but went on cutting back again over the toward the th the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment houses a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in going to have the come up she announced as we rose in the elevator of course got to call up my sister too apartment was on the top floora small living room a small dining room a small bedroom and a bath living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of only picture was an over enlarged photograph apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room old copies of lay on the table together with a copy of and some of the small scandal magazines of was first concerned with the dog reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuitsone of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight oclock the apartment was full of cheerful sun on lap called up several people on the telephone then there were no cigarettes and went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner came back they had both disappeared so sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things because it didnt make any sense to me as and after the first drink and called each other by our first names reappeared company commenced to arrive at the apartment door sister was a slender worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that wondered if she lived here when asked her she laughed immoderately repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel was a pale feminine man from the flat below had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room informed me that he was in the artistic game and gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall wife was shrill languid handsome and horrible told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty seven times since they had been married had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream coloured chiffon which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur laughter her gestures her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy creaking pivot through the smoky air dear she told her sister in a high mincing shout most of these fellas will cheat you every time they think of is money had a

secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets and saw him too looking up and wondering was within and without simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life pulled her chair close to mine and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train

action out my handkerchief wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly disappeared reappeared made plans to go somewhere and then lost each other searched for each other found each other a few feet away time toward midnight and stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether had any right to mention name shouted say it whenever want to a short deft movement broke her nose with his open hand there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor and womens voices scolding and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scenehis wife and scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of over the tapestry scenes of turned and continued on out the door my hat from the chandelier followed to lunch some day he suggested as we groaned down in the elevator your hands off the lever snapped the elevator boy beg your pardon said with dignity didnt know was touching it right agreed be glad to was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets clad in his underwear with a great portfolio in his hands and the was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the staring at the morning and waiting for the four oclock train was music from my neighbours house through the summer nights his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars high tide in the afternoon watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam weekends his became an omnibus bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains on eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing brushes and hammers and garden shears repairing the ravages of the night before five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butlers thumb least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a tree of enormous garden buffet tables garnished with glistening hors doeuvre spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another seven oclock the orchestra has arrived no thin five piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs the cars from are parked five deep in the drive and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours and hair bobbed in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each others names lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher is easier minute by minute spilled with prodigality tipped out at a cheerful word groups change more swiftly swell with new arrivals dissolve and form in the same breath already there are wanderers confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable become for a sharp joyous moment the centre of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light one of these gypsies in trembling opal seizes a cocktail out of the air dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like dances out alone on the canvas platform momentary hush the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is understudy from the party has begun believe that on the first night went to house was one of the few guests who had actually been invited were not invitedthey went there got into automobiles which bore them out to and somehow they ended up at door there they were introduced by somebody who knew and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park they came and went without having met at all came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission had been actually invited chauffeur in a uniform of robins egg blue crossed my lawn early that morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer the honour would be entirely it said if would attend his little party that night had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented itsigned in a majestic hand up in white flannels went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people didnt knowthough here and there was a face had noticed on the commuting train was immediately struck by the number of young dotted about all well dressed all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous was sure that they were selling something bonds or insurance or automobiles were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key soon as arrived made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that slunk off in the direction of the cocktail tablethe only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden or not found it necessary to attach myself to someone before should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby roared advancing toward her voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden thought you might be here she responded absently as came up remembered you lived next door to held my hand impersonally as a promise that shed take care of me in a minute and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps they cried together you didnt win was for the golf tournament had lost in the finals the week before dont know who we are said one of the girls in yellow but we met you here about a month ago dyed your hair since then remarked and started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon produced like the supper no doubt out of a caterers basket slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men each one introduced to us as you come to these parties often inquired of the girl beside her last one was the one met you at answered the girl in an alert confident voice turned to her companion it for you was for too like to

once thrill passed over all of us three bent forward and listened eagerly dont think its so much that argued sceptically more that he was a spy during the war of the men nodded in confirmation heard that from a man who knew all about him grew up with him in he assured us positively no said the first girl it couldnt be that because he was in the army during the war our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm look at him sometimes when he thinks nobodys looking at him bet he killed a man narrowed her eyes and shivered shivered all turned and looked around for was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world first supperthere would be another one after midnightwas now being served and invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden were three married couples and escort a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countrysideeast condescending to and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety get out whispered after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour this is much too polite for me got up and she explained that we were going to find the host had never met him she said and it was making me uneasy undergraduate nodded in a cynical melancholy way bar where we glanced first was crowded but was not there couldnt find him from the top of the steps and he wasnt on the veranda a chance we tried an important looking door and walked into a high library panelled with carved oak and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas stout middle aged man with enormous owl eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined from head to foot do you think he demanded impetuously what waved his hand toward the bookshelves that a matter of fact you neednt bother to ascertain ascertained real books nodded realhave pages and everything thought theyd be a nice durable cardboard of fact theyre absolutely real andhere show you our scepticism for granted he rushed to the bookcases and returned with of the he cried triumphantly a bona fide piece

girls backward in eternal graceless circles superior couples holding each other tortuously fashionably and keeping in the cornersand a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps midnight the hilarity had increased celebrated tenor had sung in and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing stunts all over the garden while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky pair of stage twins who turned out to be the girls in yellow did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls moon had risen higher and floating in the was a triangle of silver scales trembling a little to the stiff tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn was still with were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter was enjoying myself now had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant elemental and profound a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled face is familiar he said politely you in the during the war yes was in the eighth was in the until nineteen eighteen knew seen you somewhere before talked for a moment about some wet grey little villages in he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning to go with me old sport near the shore along the time time that suits you best was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when looked around and smiled a gay time now she inquired better turned again to my new acquaintance is an unusual party for me havent even seen the host live over there waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance and this man sent over his chauffeur with an invitation a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand he said suddenly exclaimed beg your pardon thought you knew old sport afraid not a very good host smiled understandinglymuch more than understandingly was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life facedor seemed to facethe whole eternal world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that at your best you hoped to convey at that point it vanishedand was looking at an elegant young roughneck a year or two over thirty whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd time before he introduced himself got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care at the moment when identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that was calling him on the wire excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn you want anything just ask for it old sport he urged me me will rejoin you later he was gone turned immediately to to assure her of my surprise had expected

told me once he was an man dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away dont believe it not dont know she insisted just dont think he went there in her tone reminded me of the other girls think he killed a man and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity would have accepted without question the information that sprang from the swamps of or from the lower of was comprehensible young men didntat least in my provincial inexperience believed they didntdrift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on he gives large parties said changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete like large parties so intimate small parties there isnt any privacy was the boom of a bass drum and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden and gentlemen he cried the request of we are going to play for you latest work which attracted so much attention at last you read the papers you know there was a big sensation smiled with jovial condescension and added sensation everybody laughed piece is known he concluded lustily as of the nature of composition eluded me because just as it began my eyes fell on standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day could see nothing sinister about him wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased the of the was over girls were putting their heads on mens shoulders in a puppyish convivial way girls were swooning backward playfully into mens arms even into groups knowing that someone would arrest their fallsbut no one swooned backward on and no bob touched shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with head for one link beg your pardon butler was suddenly standing beside us he inquired beg your pardon but would like to speak to you alone me she exclaimed in surprise madame got up slowly raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment and followed the butler toward the house noticed that she wore her evening dress all her dresses like sports clothesthere was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean crisp mornings was alone and it was almost two some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many windowed room which overhung the terrace undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls and who implored me to join him went inside large room was full of people of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall red haired young lady from a famous chorus engaged in song had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sadshe was not only singing she was weeping too there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano tears coursed down her cheeksnot freely however for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep had a fight with a man who says hes her husband explained a girl at my elbow looked around of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands party the quartet from were rent asunder by dissension of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacksat intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond and hissed promised into his ear reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices he sees having a good time he wants to go home heard anything so selfish in my life always the first ones to leave are we were almost the last tonight said one of the men sheepishly orchestra left half an hour ago spite of the wives agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility the dispute ended in a short struggle and both wives were lifted kicking into the night waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and and came out together was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands just heard the most amazing thing she whispered long were we in there about an hour was simply amazing she repeated abstractedly swore wouldnt tell it and here am tantalizing you yawned gracefully in my face come and see me book the name of aunt was hurrying off as she talkedher brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door ashamed that on my first appearance had stayed so late joined the last of guests who were clustered around him wanted to explain that hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden mention it he enjoined me eagerly give it another thought old sport familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder dont forget were going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine oclock the butler behind his shoulder wants you on the phone sir right in a minute them be right there night night night smiledand suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go as if he had desired it all the time night old sport night as walked down the steps saw that the evening was not quite over feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene the ditch beside the road right side up but violently shorn of one wheel rested a new coup which had left drive not two minutes before sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant puzzled way he explained went in the ditch fact was infinitely astonishing to him and recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the manit was the late patron of library it happen shrugged his shoulders know nothing whatever about mechanics he said decisively how did it happen you run into the wall ask me said washing his hands of the whole matter know very little about drivingnext to nothing happened and thats all know if youre a poor driver you oughtnt to try driving at night wasnt even trying he explained indignantly wasnt even trying awed hush fell upon the bystanders you want to commit suicide lucky it was just a wheel bad driver and not even trying dont understand explained the criminal wasnt driving another man in the car shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained h h as the door of the coup swung slowly open crowdit was now a crowdstepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause very gradually part by part a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster matter he inquired calmly we run outa gas a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheelhe stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky came off someone explained nodded first din notice wed stopped pause taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice tell me where theres a gasline station least a dozen men some of them a little better off than he was explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond out he suggested after a moment her in reverse the wheels off hesitated harm in trying he said caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and turned away and cut across the lawn toward home glanced back once wafer of a moon was shining over house making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell over what have written so far see have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and until much later they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs of the time worked the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as hurried down the white chasms of lower to the knew the other clerks and young bond salesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee even had a short affair with a girl who lived in and worked in the accounting department but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in let it blow quietly away took dinner usually at the some reason it was the gloomiest event of my dayand then went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work that if the night was mellow strolled down past the old and over rd to the began to like the racy adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye liked to walk up and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes was going to enter into their lives and no one would ever know or disapprove in my mind followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness the enchanted metropolitan twilight felt a haunting loneliness sometimes and felt it in otherspoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinneryoung clerks in the dusk wasting the most poignant moments of night and life at eight oclock when the dark lanes of the were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs bound for the theatre district felt a sinking in my heart leaned together in the taxis as they waited and voices sang and there was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside that too was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement wished them well a while lost sight of and then in midsummer found her again first was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her name it was something more wasnt actually in love but felt a sort of tender curiosity bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed somethingmost affectations conceal something eventually even though they dont in the beginningand one day found what it was we were on a house party together up in she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down and then lied about itand suddenly remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapersa suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round thing approached the proportions of a scandalthen died away caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken incident and the name had remained together in my mind instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible was incurably dishonest wasnt able to endure being at a disadvantage and given this unwillingness suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body made no difference to me in a woman is a thing you never blame deeplyi was casually sorry and then forgot was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one mans coat a rotten driver protested you ought to be more careful or you oughtnt to drive at all am careful youre not other people are she said lightly that got to do with it keep out of my way she insisted takes two to make an accident you met somebody just as careless as yourself hope never will she answered hate careless people why like you grey sun strained eyes stared straight ahead but she had deliberately shifted our relations and for a moment thought loved her am slow thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires and knew that first had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home been writing letters once a week and signing them and all could think of was how when that certain girl played tennis a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before was free suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues and this is mine am one of the few honest people that have ever known morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore the world and its mistress returned

in dressed in white and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night for an hour came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant had never seen before were so engrossed in each other that she didnt see me until was five feet away she called unexpectedly come here was flattered that she wanted to speak to me because of all the older girls admired her most asked me if was going to the to make bandages was then would tell them that she couldnt come that day officer looked at while she was speaking in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime and because it seemed romantic to me have

beaux myself and began to play in tournaments so didnt see very often went with a slightly older crowdwhen she went with anyone at all rumours were circulating about herhow her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas was effectually prevented but she wasnt on speaking terms with her family for several weeks that she didnt play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat footed shortsighted young men in town who couldnt get into the army at all the next autumn she was gay again gay as ever had a dbut after the armistice and in she was presumably engaged to a man from she married of with more pomp and circumstance than ever knew before came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars was a bridesmaid came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the night in her flowered dressand as drunk as a monkey had a bottle of in one hand and a letter in the other me she muttered had a drink before but oh how do enjoy it the matter was scared can tell you never seen a girl like that before dearies groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls em downstairs and give em back to whoever they belong to em all change her mine change her mine began to cryshe cried and cried rushed out and found her mothers maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath wouldnt let go of the letter took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow she didnt say another word gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over day at five oclock she married without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months trip to the saw them in when they came back and thought never seen a girl so mad about her husband he left the room for a minute shed look around uneasily and say gone and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight was touching to see them togetherit made you laugh in a hushed fascinated way was in week after left ran into a wagon on the road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was brokenshe was one of the chambermaids in the next had her little girl and they went to for a year saw them one spring in and later in and then they came back to to settle down was popular in as you know moved with a fast crowd all of them young and rich and wild but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation because she doesnt drink a great advantage not to drink among hard drinking people can hold your tongue and moreover you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they dont see or care never went in for amour at alland yet theres something in that voice of hers about six weeks ago she heard the name for the first time in years was when asked youdo you rememberif you knew in you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up and said and when described himi was half asleepshe said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know wasnt until then that connected this with the officer in her white car had finished telling all this we had left the for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the and the clear voices of children already gathered like crickets on the grass rose through the hot twilight the of love belongs to me night when youre asleep your tent creep was a strange coincidence said it wasnt a coincidence at all not bought that house so that would be just across the bay it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that night came alive to me delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour wants to know continued if youll invite to your house some afternoon and then let him come over modesty of the demand shook me had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual mothsso that he could come over some afternoon to a strangers garden have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing afraid hes waited so long thought you might be offended see hes regular tough underneath it all worried me didnt he ask you to arrange a meeting wants her to see his house she explained your house is right next door think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties some night went on but she never did he began asking people casually if they knew her and was the first one he found was that night he sent for me at his dance and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it course immediately suggested a luncheon in thought hed go mad dont want to do anything out of the way he kept saying want to see her right next door said you were a particular friend of he started to abandon the whole idea doesnt know very much about though he says hes read a paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of name was dark now and as we dipped under a little bridge put my arm around golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner wasnt thinking of and any more but of this clean hard limited person who dealt in universal scepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement are only the pursued the pursuing the busy and the tired ought to have something in her life murmured to me she want to see not to know about it doesnt want her to know just supposed to invite her to tea passed a barrier of dark trees and then the faade of a block of delicate pale light beamed down into the park and had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so drew up the girl beside me tightening my arms wan scornful mouth smiled and so drew her up again closer this time to my face came home to that night was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire oclock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires a corner saw that it was house lit from tower to cellar first thought it was another party a wild rout that had resolved itself into hide and go seek or sardines in the box with all the house thrown open to the game there wasnt a sound wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness my taxi groaned away saw walking toward me across his lawn place looks like the said it turned his eyes toward it absently have been glancing into some of the rooms go to old sport my car too late suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool havent made use of it all summer got to go to bed right waited looking at me with suppressed eagerness talked with said after a moment going to call up tomorrow and invite her over here to tea thats all right he said carelessly dont want to put you to any trouble day would suit you day would suit you he corrected me quickly dont want to put you to any trouble you see about the day after tomorrow considered for a moment with reluctance want to get the grass cut he said both looked down at the grassthere was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker well kept expanse of his began suspected that he meant my grass another little thing he said uncertainly and hesitated you rather put it off for a few days asked it isnt about that least fumbled with a series of beginnings thoughtwhy look here old sport you dont make much money do you very much seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently thought you didnt if youll pardon myyou see carry on a little business on the side a sort of side line you understand thought that if you dont make very muchyoure selling bonds arent you old sport to this would interest you wouldnt take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered had no choice except to cut him off there got my hands full said much obliged but couldnt take on any more work wouldnt have to do any business with he thought that was shying away from the gonnegtion mentioned at lunch but assured him he was wrong waited a moment longer hoping begin a conversation but was too absorbed to be responsive so he went unwillingly home evening had made me lightheaded and happy think walked into a deep sleep as entered my front door dont know whether or not went to or for how many hours he glanced into rooms while his house blazed gaudily on called up from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea bring warned her bring is she asked innocently day agreed upon was pouring rain eleven oclock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn mower tapped at my front door and said that had sent him over to cut my grass reminded me that had forgotten to tell my to come back so drove into to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers flowers were unnecessary for at two oclock a greenhouse arrived from with innumerable receptacles to contain it hour later the front door opened nervously and in a white flannel suit silver shirt and gold coloured tie hurried in was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes everything all right he asked immediately grass looks fine if thats what you mean grass he inquired blankly the grass in the yard looked out the window at it but judging from his expression dont believe he saw a thing very good he remarked vaguely of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four think it was you got everything you need in the shape ofof tea took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop they do asked course of course fine and he added hollowly old sport rain cooled about half past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew looked with vacant eyes through a copy of starting at the tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home that coming to tea too late looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere cant wait all day be silly its just two minutes to four sat down miserably as if had pushed him and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane both jumped up and a little harrowed myself went out into the yard the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive stopped face tipped sideways beneath a three cornered lavender hat looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile this absolutely where you live my dearest one exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain had to follow the sound of it for a moment up and down with my ear alone before any words came through damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as took it to help her from the car you in love with me she said low in my ear or why did have to come alone the secret of your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour back in an hour in a grave murmur name is the gasoline affect his nose dont think so she said innocently went in my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted thats funny exclaimed funny turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door went out and opened it pale as death with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the living room wasnt a bit funny of the loud beating of my own heart pulled the door to against the increasing rain half a minute there wasnt a sound from the living room heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by voice on a clear artificial note certainly am awfully glad to see you again pause it endured horribly had nothing to do in the hall so went into the room his hands still in his pockets was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease even of boredom head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair met before muttered eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place he sat down rigidly his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand sorry about the clock he said own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn couldnt muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head an old clock told them idiotically think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor havent met for many years said her voice as matter of fact as it could ever be years next automatic quality of answer set us all back at least another minute had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac brought it in on a tray the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself got himself into a shadow and while and talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes as calmness wasnt an end in itself made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet are you going demanded in immediate alarm be back got to speak to you about something before you go followed me wildly into the kitchen closed the door and whispered in a miserable way the matter is a terrible mistake he said shaking his head from side to side a terrible terrible mistake just embarrassed thats all and luckily added embarrassed too embarrassed he repeated incredulously as much as you are talk so loud acting like a little boy broke out impatiently only that but youre rude sitting in there all alone raised his hand to stop my words looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room walked out the back wayjust as had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour beforeand ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain more it was pouring and my irregular lawn well shaved by gardener abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes was nothing to look at from under the tree except enormous house so stared at it like at his church steeple for half an hour brewer had built it early in the period craze a decade before and there was a story that hed agreed to pay five years taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw their refusal took the heart out of his plan to a went into an immediate decline children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door while willing even eager to be serfs have always been obstinate about being peasantry half an hour the sun shone again and the grocers automobile rounded drive with the raw material for his servants dinneri felt sure he wouldnt eat a spoonful maid began opening the upper windows of his house appeared momentarily in each and leaning from the large central bay spat meditatively into the garden was time went back the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion in the new silence felt that silence had fallen within the house too went inafter making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stovebut dont believe they heard a sound were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air and every vestige of embarrassment was gone face was smeared with tears and when came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror there was a change in that was simply confounding literally glowed without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well being radiated from him and filled the little room hello old sport he said as if he hadnt seen me for years thought for a moment he was going to shake hands stopped raining it he realized what was talking about that there were twinkle bells of sunshine in the room he smiled like a weather man like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light and repeated the news to do you think of that stopped raining glad throat full of aching grieving beauty told only of her unexpected joy want you and to come over to my house he said like to show her around sure you want me to come old sport went upstairs to wash her facetoo late thought with humiliation of my towelswhile and waited on the lawn house looks well doesnt it he demanded how the whole front of it catches the light agreed that it was splendid eyes went over it every arched door and square tower took me just three years to earn the money that bought it thought you inherited your money did old sport he said automatically but lost most of it in the big panicthe panic of the war think he hardly knew what he was saying for when asked him what business he was in he answered my affair before he realized that it wasnt an appropriate reply been in several things he corrected himself was in the drug business and then was in the oil business not in either one now looked at me with more attention you mean youve been thinking over what proposed the other night could answer came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight huge place there she cried pointing you like it love it but dont see how you live there all alone keep it always full of interesting people night and day who do interesting things people of taking the shortcut along the we went down to the road and entered by the big postern enchanting murmurs admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky admired the gardens the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss me at the gate was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees inside as we wandered through music rooms and felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through closed the door of the could have sworn heard the owl eyed man break into ghostly laughter went upstairs through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers through dressing rooms and poolrooms and bathrooms with sunken bathsintruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor was the boarder had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning we came to own apartment a bedroom and a bath and an study where we sat down and drank a glass of some he took from a cupboard in the wall hadnt once ceased looking at and think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well loved eyes too he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs bedroom was the simplest room of allexcept where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair whereupon sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh the funniest thing old sport he said hilariously cantwhen try to had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence had been full of the idea so long dreamed it right through to the end waited with his teeth set so to speak at an inconceivable pitch of intensity in the reaction he was running down like an over wound clock himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing gowns and ties and his shirts piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high got a man in who buys me clothes sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season spring and fall took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many coloured disarray we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted highershirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of indian blue with a strained sound bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily such beautiful shirts she sobbed her voice muffled in the thick folds makes me sad because never seen suchsuch beautiful shirts before the house we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowersbut outside window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the it wasnt for the mist we could see your home across the bay said always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever to the great distance that had separated him from it had seemed very near to her almost touching her had seemed as close as a star to the moon it was again a green light on a dock count of enchanted objects had diminished by one began to walk about the room examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me hung on the wall over his desk this old sport name sounded faintly familiar dead now used to be my best friend years ago was a small picture of also in yachting costume on the bureaugatsby with his head thrown back defiantlytaken apparently when he was about eighteen adore it exclaimed pompadour never told me you had a pompadouror a yacht at this said quickly a lot of clippingsabout you stood side by side examining it was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and took up the receiver cant talk now cant talk now old sport said a small town must know what a small town is hes no use to us if is his idea of a small town rang off here quick cried at the window rain was still falling but the darkness had parted in the west and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea at that she whispered and then after a moment like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around tried to go then but they wouldnt hear of it perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone know what well do said well have play the piano went out of the room calling and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed slightly worn young man with shell rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair was now decently clothed in a sport shirt open at the neck sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue we interrupt your exercise inquired politely was asleep cried in a spasm of embarrassment is been asleep got up plays the piano said cutting him off you old sport dont play well donthardly play at all all out of prac go downstairs interrupted flipped a switch grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light the music room turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano lit cigarette from a trembling match and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall had played he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for in the gloom all out of practice you see told you couldnt play all out of prac talk so much old sport commanded the morning the evening we got fun the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the the lights were going on in now the electric trains men carrying were plunging home through the rain from was the hour of a profound human change and excitement was generating on the air things sure and nothings surer rich get richer and the poor getchildren the meantime between time went over to say goodbye saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into face as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness five years must have been moments even that afternoon when tumbled short of his dreamsnot through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion had gone beyond her beyond everything had thrown himself into it with a creative passion adding to it all the time decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart watched him he adjusted himself a little visibly hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion think that voice held him most with its fluctuating feverish warmth because it couldnt be over dreamedthat voice was a deathless song had forgotten me but glanced up and held out her hand didnt know me now at all looked once more at them and they looked back at me remotely possessed by intense life went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain leaving

hurried out to see was a random shot and yet the reporters instinct was right notoriety spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news legends such as the underground pipeline to attached themselves to him and there was one persistent story that he didnt live in a house at all but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the shore why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to of isnt easy to say was really or at least legally his name had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his careerwhen he saw yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on was who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants but it was already who borrowed a rowboat pulled out to the and informed that a wind might catch him and break him up

invented just the sort of that a seventeen year old boy would be likely to invent and to this conception he was faithful to the end over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed brown hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce half lazy work of the bracing days knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them of young virgins because they were ignorant of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self absorption he took for granted his heart was in a constant turbulent riot most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairys wing instinct toward his future glory had led him some months before to the small of in southern stayed there two weeks dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny to destiny itself and despising the janitors work with which he was to pay his way through he drifted back to and he was still searching for something to do on the day that yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore was fifty years old then a product of the silver fields of the of every rush for metal since seventy five transactions in copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft mindedness and suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money none too savoury ramifications by which the newspaper woman played de to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht were common property of the turgid journalism in had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as destiny in young resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world suppose he smiled at had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled any rate asked him a few questions one of them elicited the brand new name and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious few days later he took him to and bought him a blue coat six pairs of white duck trousers and a yachting cap when the left for the and the left too was employed in a vague personal capacitywhile he remained with he was in turn steward mate skipper secretary and even jailor for sober knew what lavish doings drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that came on board one night in and a week later inhospitably died remember the portrait of him up in bedroom a grey florid man with a hard empty facethe pioneer debauchee who during one phase of life brought back to the seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon was indirectly due to that drank so little in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone it was from that he inherited moneya legacy of twenty five thousand dollars didnt get it never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to was left with his singularly appropriate education the vague contour of had filled out to the substantiality of a man told me all this very much later but put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents which werent even faintly true he told it to me at a time of confusion when had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him take advantage of this short halt while so to speak caught his breath to clear this set of misconceptions away was a halt too in my association with his affairs several weeks didnt see him or hear his voice on the phonemostly was in trotting around with and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile auntbut finally went over to his house one afternoon hadnt been there two minutes when somebody brought in for a drink was startled naturally but the really surprising thing was that it hadnt happened before were a party of three on horsebacktom and a man named and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously delighted to see you said standing on his porch delighted that you dropped in though they cared right down a cigarette or a cigar walked around the room quickly ringing bells have something to drink for you in just a minute was profoundly affected by the fact that was there he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for wanted nothing lemonade thanks little champagne at all thanks sorry you have a nice ride good roads around here suppose the automobiles by an irresistible impulse turned to who had accepted the introduction as a stranger believe weve met somewhere before yes said gruffly polite but obviously not remembering we did remember very well two weeks ago right were with here know your wife continued almost aggressively so turned to me live near here door so didnt enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair the woman said nothing eitheruntil unexpectedly after two highballs she became cordial all come over to your next party she suggested do you say be delighted to have you ver nice said without gratitude ought to be starting home dont hurry urged them had control of

doesnt want him says she does want him has a big dinner party and he wont know a soul there frowned wonder where in the devil he met may be old fashioned in my ideas but women run around too much these days to suit me meet all kinds of crazy fish and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses on said to were late got to go then to me him we couldnt wait will you and shook hands the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive disappearing under the foliage just as with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door was evidently perturbed at running around alone for on the following night he came with her to party his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressivenessit stands out in my memory from other parties that summer were the same people or at least the same sort of people the same profusion of champagne the same many coloured many keyed commotion but felt an unpleasantness in the air a pervading harshness that hadnt been there before perhaps had merely grown used to it grown to accept as a world complete in itself with its own standards and its own great figures second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so and now was looking at it again through eyes is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat things excite me so she whispered you want to kiss me any time during the evening just let me know and be glad to arrange it for you mention my name present a green card giving out green around suggested looking around having a marvellous must see the faces of many people youve heard about arrogant eyes roamed the crowd dont go around very much he said in fact was just thinking dont know a soul here you know that lady indicated a gorgeous scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree and stared with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies lovely said man bending over her is her director took them ceremoniously from group to group and an instants hesitation he added the polo player no objected quickly not me evidently the sound of it pleased for remained the polo player for the rest of the evening never met so many celebrities exclaimed liked that manwhat was his namewith the sort of blue nose identified him adding that he was a small producer liked him anyhow a little rather not be the polo player said pleasantly rather look at all these famous people inin oblivion and danced remember being surprised by his graceful conservative foxtroti had never seen him dance before they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request remained watchfully in the garden case theres a fire or a flood she explained or any act of appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together you mind if eat with some people over here he said fellows getting off some funny stuff ahead answered genially and if you want to take down any addresses heres my little gold pencil looked around after a moment and told me the girl was common but pretty and knew that except for the half hour shed been alone with she wasnt having a good time were at a particularly tipsy table was my faultgatsby had been called to the phone and enjoyed these same people only two weeks before what had amused me then turned septic on the air now do you feel girl addressed was trying unsuccessfully to slump against my shoulder this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes massive and lethargic woman who had been urging to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow spoke in defence shes all right now shes had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that tell her she ought to leave it alone do leave it alone affirmed the accused hollowly heard you yelling so said to here somebody that needs your help much obliged sure said another friend without gratitude but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool hate is to get my head stuck in a pool mumbled almost drowned me once over in you ought to leave it alone countered for yourself cried violently hand shakes wouldnt let you operate on me was like that the last thing remember was standing with and watching the moving picture director and his were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity and even while watched saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek like her said think shes lovely the rest offended herand inarguably because it wasnt a gesture but an emotion was appalled by this unprecedented place that had begotten upon a fishing villageappalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car was dark here in front only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning a shadow moved against a dressing room blind above gave way to another shadow an indefinite procession of shadows who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass is this anyhow demanded suddenly big bootlegger you hear that inquired didnt hear it imagined it lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers you know said shortly was silent for a moment pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together breeze stirred the grey haze of fur collar least they are more interesting than the people we know she said with an effort didnt look so interested was laughed and turned to me you notice face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly following it in a way contralto voices have and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air of people come who havent been invited she said suddenly girl hadnt been invited simply force their way in and hes too polite to object like to know who he is and what he does insisted think make a point of finding out can tell you right now she answered owned some drugstores a lot of drugstores built them up himself dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive night said glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where in the a neat sad little waltz of that year was drifting out the open door all in the very casualness of party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside would happen now in the dim incalculable hours some unbelievable guest would arrive a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at one moment of magical encounter would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion stayed late that night asked me to wait until he was free and lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up chilled and exalted from the black beach until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face and his eyes were bright and tired didnt like it he said immediately course she did didnt like it he insisted didnt have a good time was silent and guessed at his unutterable depression feel far away from her he said hard to make her understand mean about the dance dance dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers sport the dance is unimportant wanted nothing less of than that she should go to and say never loved you she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken of them was that after she was free they were to go back to and be married from her housejust as if it were five years ago she doesnt understand he said used to be able to understand sit for hours broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers wouldnt ask too much of her ventured cant repeat the past repeat the past he cried incredulously of course you can looked around him wildly as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house just out of reach of his hand going to fix everything just the way it was before he said nodding determinedly see talked a lot about the past and gathered that he wanted to recover something some idea of himself perhaps that had gone into loving life had been confused and disordered since then but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly he could find out what that thing was autumn night five years before they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight stopped here and turned toward each other it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars of the corner of his eye saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the treeshe could climb to it if he climbed alone and once there he could suck on the pap of life gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder heart beat faster as white face came up to his own knew that when he kissed this girl and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath his mind would never romp again like the mind of he waited listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star he kissed her his lips touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete all he said even through his appalling sentimentality was reminded of somethingan elusive rhythm a fragment of lost words that had heard somewhere a long time ago a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb mans as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air they made no sound and what had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever was when curiosity about was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one nightand as obscurely as it had begun his career as was over gradually did become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away if he were sick went over to find outan unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door sick a pause he added sir in a dilatory grudging way hadnt seen him around and was rather worried him came over he demanded rudely right tell him he slammed the door informed me that had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others who never went into village to be bribed by the tradesmen but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty and the general opinion in the village was that the new people werent servants at all day called me on the phone away inquired old sport hear you fired all your servants wanted somebody who wouldnt gossip comes over quite oftenin the afternoons the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes some people wanted to do something for all brothers and sisters used to run a small hotel see was calling up at requestwould come to lunch at her house tomorrow would be there an hour later herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that was coming was up yet couldnt believe that they would choose this occasion for a sceneespecially for the rather harrowing scene that had outlined in the garden next day was broiling almost the last certainly the warmest of the summer my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight only the hot whistles of the broke the simmering hush at noon straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist and then as her newspaper dampened under her fingers lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry pocketbook slapped to the floor my she gasped picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her holding it at arms length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that had no designs upon itbut everyone near by including the woman suspected me just the same said the conductor to familiar faces weather it hot enough for you it hot it commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart the hall of the house blew a faint wind carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to and

came toward us glistening slightly to take our stiff straw hats expects you in the salon he cried needlessly indicating the direction this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store

love you she murmured forget theres a lady present said looked around doubtfully kiss too a low vulgar girl dont care cried and began to clog on the brick fireplace she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room sed pre cious she crooned holding out her arms to your own mother that loves you child relinquished by the nurse rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mothers dress bles sed pre cious mother get powder on your old yellowy hair up now and sayhow de do and in turn leaned down

that pretty soon the earths going to fall into the sunor wait a minuteits just the oppositethe suns getting colder every year outside he suggested to like you to have a look at the place went with them out to the veranda the green stagnant in the heat one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea eyes followed it momentarily he raised his hand and pointed across the bay right across from

ocean and the abounding blessed isles sport for you said nodding like to be out there with him for about an hour had luncheon in the dining room darkened too against the heat and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale we do with ourselves this afternoon cried and the day after that and the next thirty years be morbid said starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall its so hot insisted on the verge of tears and everythings so confused all go to town voice struggled on through the heat beating against it moulding its senselessness into forms heard of making a garage out of a

we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first smoked all through lunch lets have fun she begged him too hot to fuss didnt answer it your own way she said on went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky started to speak changed his mind but not before wheeled and faced him expectantly you got your stables here asked with an effort a quarter of a mile down the road pause dont see the idea of going to town broke out savagely get these notions in their heads we take anything to drink called from an upper window get some whisky answered went inside turned to me rigidly cant say anything in his house old sport got an indiscreet voice remarked full of hesitated voice is full of money he said suddenly was it never understood before was full of moneythat was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it the jingle of it the cymbals song of it in a white palace the kings daughter the golden girl came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel followed by and wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms we all go in my car suggested felt the hot green leather of the seat ought to have left it in the shade it standard shift demanded you take my coup and let me drive your car to town suggestion was distasteful to dont think theres much gas he objected of gas said boisterously looked at the gauge if it runs out can stop at a drugstore can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays pause followed this apparently pointless remark looked at frowning and an indefinable expression at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable as if had only heard it described in words passed over face on said pressing her with his hand toward car take you in this circus wagon opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm take and follow you in the coup walked close to touching his coat with her hand and and got into the front seat of car pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind you see that demanded what looked at me keenly realizing that and must have known all along think pretty dumb dont you he suggested am but have aalmost a second sight sometimes that tells me what to do you dont believe that but science paused immediate contingency overtook him pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss made a small investigation of this fellow he continued could have gone deeper if known you mean youve been to a medium inquired humorously he stared at us as we laughed medium havent said been making a small investigation of his past you found he was an man said helpfully man was incredulous hell he is wears a pink suit hes an man snorted contemptuously or something like that youre such a snob why did you invite him to lunch demanded crossly invited him she knew him before we were marriedgod knows where were all irritable now with the fading ale and aware of it we drove for a while in silence as faded eyes came into sight down the road remembered caution about gasoline got enough to get us to town said theres a garage right here objected dont want to get stalled in this baking heat threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under sign a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow eyed at the car have some gas cried roughly do you think we stopped forto admire the view sick said without moving sick all day the matter all run down shall help myself demanded sounded well enough on the phone an effort left the shade and support of the doorway and breathing hard unscrewed the cap of the tank the sunlight his face was green didnt mean to interrupt your lunch he said need money pretty bad and was wondering what you were going to do with your old car do you like this one inquired bought it last week a nice yellow one said as he strained at the handle to buy it chance smiled faintly but could make some money on the other do you want money for all of a sudden been here too long want to get away wife and want to go wife does exclaimed startled been talking about it for ten years rested for a moment against the pump shading his eyes now shes going whether she wants to or not going to get her away coup flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand do owe you demanded harshly just got wised up to something funny the last two days remarked why want to get away why been bothering you about the car do owe you twenty relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and had a bad moment there before realized that so far his suspicions hadnt alighted on had discovered that had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick stared at him and then at who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour beforeand it occurred to me that there was no difference between men in intelligence or race so profound as the difference between the sick and the well was so sick that he looked guilty unforgivably guiltyas if he had just got some poor girl with child let you have that car said send it over tomorrow afternoon locality was always vaguely disquieting even in the broad glare of afternoon and now turned my head as though had been warned of something behind the ash heaps the giant eyes of kept their vigil but perceived after a moment that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and was peering down at the car engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture expression was curiously familiarit was an expression had often seen on womens faces but on face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until realized that her eyes wide with jealous terror were fixed not on but on whom she took to be his wife is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind and as we drove away was feeling the hot whips of panic wife and his mistress until an hour ago secure and inviolate were slipping precipitately from his control made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking and leaving behind and we sped along toward at fifty miles an hour until among the spidery girders of the elevated we came in sight of the easygoing blue coup big movies around are cool suggested love on summer afternoons when everyones away something very sensuous about itoverripe as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands word sensuous had the effect of further disquieting but before he could invent a protest the coup came to a stop and signalled us to draw up alongside are we going she cried about the movies so hot she complained go ride around and meet you after an effort her wit rose faintly meet you on some corner be the man smoking two cigarettes cant argue about it here said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us follow me to the south side of in front of the times he turned his head and looked back for their car and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever they didnt we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me though have a sharp physical memory that in the course of it my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back notion originated with suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths and then assumed more tangible form as a place to have a mint julep of us said over and over that it was a crazy ideawe all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought or pretended to think that we were being very funny room was large and stifling and though it was already four oclock opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the went to the mirror and stood with her back to us fixing her hair a swell suite whispered respectfully and everyone laughed another window commanded without turning around arent any more wed better telephone for an axe thing to do is to forget about the heat said impatiently make it ten times worse by crabbing about it unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table not let her alone old sport remarked the one that wanted to come to town was a moment of silence telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor whereupon whispered mebut this time no one laughed pick it up offered got it examined the parted string muttered in an interested way and tossed the book on a chair a great expression of yours isnt it said sharply is this old sport business you pick that up see here said turning around from the mirror if youre going to make personal remarks wont stay here a minute up and order some ice for the mint

feet vivid with excitement never loved you do you hear he cried only married you because was poor and she was tired of waiting for me was a terrible mistake but in her heart she never loved anyone

their emotions down voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note been going on want to hear all about it told you whats been going on said on for five yearsand you didnt know turned to sharply been seeing this fellow for five years seeing said we couldnt meet both of us loved each other all that time old sport and you didnt know used to laugh sometimesbut there was no laughter in his eyesto

that they didnt treat you to the story of that little spree walked over and stood beside her thats all over now he said earnestly doesnt matter any more tell him the truththat you never loved himand its all wiped out forever looked at him blindly could love himpossibly never loved him hesitated eyes fell on and me with a sort of appeal as though she realized at last what she was doingand as though she had never all along intended doing anything at all it was done now was too late never loved him she said with perceptible reluctance at demanded suddenly the ballroom beneath muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air that day carried you down from the to keep your shoes dry was a husky tenderness in his tone dont voice was cold but the rancour was gone from it looked at she saidbut her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet you want too much she cried to love you nowisnt that enough cant help whats past began to sob helplessly did love him oncebut loved you too eyes opened and closed loved me too he repeated thats a lie said savagely didnt know you were alive things

admitted in a pitiful voice wouldnt be true course it wouldnt agreed turned to her husband if it mattered to you she said course it matters going to take better care of you from now on dont understand said with a touch of panic not going to take care of her any more not opened his eyes wide and laughed could afford to control himself now that leaving you am though she said with a visible effort not leaving me words suddenly leaned down over not for a common swindler whod have to steal the ring he put on her finger wont stand this cried please lets get out are you anyhow broke out one of that bunch that hangs around with much happen to know made a little investigation into your affairsand carry it further tomorrow can suit yourself about that old sport said steadily found out what your drugstores were turned to us and spoke rapidly and this bought up a lot of side street drugstores here and in and sold grain alcohol over the counter one of his little stunts picked him for a bootlegger the first time saw him and wasnt far wrong about it said politely guess your friend wasnt too proud to come in on it you left him in the lurch didnt you let him go to jail for a month over in ought to hear on the subject of you came to us dead broke was very glad to pick up some money old sport you call me old sport cried said nothing could have you up on the betting laws too but scared him into shutting his mouth unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in face drugstore business was just small change continued slowly but youve got something on now that afraid to tell me about glanced at who was staring terrified between and her husband and at who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin turned back to was startled at his expression lookedand this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his gardenas if he had killed a man a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way passed and he began to talk excitedly to denying everything defending his name against accusations that had not been made with every word she was drawing further and further into herself so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away trying to touch what was no longer tangible struggling unhappily undespairingly toward that lost voice across the room voice begged again to go cant stand this any more frightened eyes told that whatever intentions whatever courage she had had were definitely gone two start on home said car looked at alarmed now but he insisted with magnanimous scorn on wont annoy you think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over were gone without a word snapped out made accidental isolated like ghosts even from our pity a moment got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whisky in the towel any of this stuff didnt answer asked again any just remembered that todays my birthday was thirty me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade was seven oclock when we got into the coup with him and started for talked incessantly exulting and laughing but his voice was as remote from and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind promise of a decade of loneliness a thinning list of single men to know a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm thinning hair there was beside me who unlike was too wise ever to carry well forgotten dreams from age to age we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coats shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight young who ran the coffee joint beside the ash heaps was the principal witness at the inquest had slept through the heat until after five when he strolled over to the garage and found sick in his officereally sick pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over advised him to go to bed but refused saying that hed miss a lot of business if he did his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead got my wife locked in up there explained calmly going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then were going to move away was astonished they had been neighbours for four years and had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement he was one of these worn out men when he wasnt working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable colourless way was his wifes man and not his own naturally tried to find out what had happened but wouldnt say a wordinstead he began to throw curious suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what hed been doing at certain times on certain days as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and took the opportunity to get away intending to come back later he didnt supposed he forgot to thats all he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard voice loud and scolding downstairs in the garage me he heard her cry me down and beat me you dirty little coward moment later she rushed out into the dusk waving her hands and shoutingbefore he could move from his door the business was over death car as the newspapers called it didnt stop it came out of the gathering darkness wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend wasnt even sure of its colourhe told the first policeman that it was light green other car the one going toward came to rest a hundred yards beyond and its driver hurried back to where her life violently extinguished knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away said good have a little business at last slowed down but still without any intention of stopping until as we came nearer the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes take a look he said doubtfully just a look became aware now of a hollow wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage a sound which as we got out of the coup and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words my uttered over and over in a gasping moan some bad trouble here said excitedly reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation it was a minute before could see anything at all new arrivals deranged the line and and were pushed suddenly inside body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a worktable by the wall and with his back to us was bending over it motionless to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book first couldnt find the source of the high groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garagethen saw standing on the raised threshold of his office swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder but neither heard nor saw eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call my od my od od my od lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman a v the policeman was saying o r corrected the man a v r o to me muttered fiercely r said the policeman o g g looked up as broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder you want fella happenedthats what want to know hit her killed killed repeated staring ran out ina road of a bitch didnt even stopus car was two cars said one comin one goin see where asked the policeman keenly goin each way shehis hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his sideshe ran out there an the one comin from knock right into her goin thirty or forty miles an hour the name of this place here demanded the officer got any name pale well dressed negro stepped near was a yellow car he said big yellow car the accident asked the policeman but the car passed me down the road going fastern forty fifty sixty here and lets have your name out now want to get his name words of this conversation must have reached swaying in the office door for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries dont have to tell me what kind of car it was know what kind of car it was saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat walked quickly over to and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms got to pull yourself together he said with soothing gruffness eyes fell upon he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not held him upright said shaking him a little just got here a minute ago from was bringing you that coup weve been talking about yellow car was driving this afternoon wasnt minedo you hear havent seen it all afternoon the negro and were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes all that he demanded a friend of his turned his head but kept his hands firm on body says he knows the car that did it was a yellow car dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at what colours your car a blue car a coup come straight from said who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away if youll let me have that name again correct up like a doll carried him into the office set him down in a chair and came back somebodyll come here and sit with him he snapped authoritatively watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room shut the door on them and came down the single step his eyes avoiding the table he passed close to me he whispered get out consciously with his authoritative arms breaking the way we pushed through the still gathering crowd passing a hurried doctor case in hand who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago drove slowly until we were beyond the bendthen his foot came down hard and the coup raced along through the night a little while heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face damned coward he whimpered didnt even stop his car house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines home he said we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly ought to have dropped you in nothing we can do tonight change had come over him and he spoke gravely and with decision we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases telephone for a taxi to take you home and while youre waiting you and better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supperif you want any opened the door in thanks be glad if youd order me the taxi wait outside put her hand on my arm you come in thanks was feeling a little sick and wanted to be alone lingered for a moment more only half past nine she said be damned if go in had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included too must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands until heard the phone taken up inside and the butlers voice calling a taxi walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate hadnt gone twenty yards when heard my name and stepped from between two bushes into the path must have felt pretty weird by that time because could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon are you doing inquired standing here old sport that seemed a despicable occupation all knew he was going to rob the house in a moment wouldnt have been surprised to see sinister faces the faces of people behind him in the dark shrubbery you see any trouble on the road he asked after a minute hesitated she killed thought so told thought so better that the shock should all come at once stood it pretty well spoke as if reaction was the only thing that mattered got to by a side road he went on and left the car in my garage dont think anybody saw us but of course cant be sure disliked him so much by this time that didnt find it necessary to tell him he was wrong was the woman he inquired name was husband owns the garage the devil did it happen tried to swing the wheel broke off and suddenly guessed at the truth driving he said after a moment but of course say was see when we left she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to driveand this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us thought we were somebody she knew first turned away from the woman toward the other car and then she lost her nerve and turned back second my hand reached the wheel felt the shockit must have killed her instantly ripped her open tell me old sport winced stepped on it tried to make her stop but she couldnt so pulled on the emergency brake she fell over into my lap and drove on be all right tomorrow he said presently just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality shes going to turn the light out and on again wont touch her said not thinking about her dont trust him old sport long are you going to wait night if necessary till they all go to bed new point of view occurred to me found out that had been driving might think he saw a connection in ithe might think anything looked at the house there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from room on the ground floor wait here said see if theres any sign of a commotion walked back along the border of the lawn traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps drawing room curtains were open and saw that the room was empty the porch where we had dined that night three months before came to a small rectangle of light which guessed was the pantry window blind was drawn but found a rift at the sill and were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement werent happy and neither of them had touched the chicken or the aleand yet they werent unhappy either was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together tiptoed from the porch heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house was waiting where had left him in the drive it all quiet up there he asked anxiously its all quiet hesitated better come home and get some sleep shook his head want to wait here till goes to bed night old sport put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil walked away and left him standing there in the moonlightwatching over nothing couldnt sleep all night a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the and tossed half sick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams dawn heard a taxi go up drive and immediately jumped out of bed and began to dressi felt that had something to tell him something to warn him about and morning would be too late his lawn saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall heavy with dejection or sleep happened he said wanly waited and about four oclock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switchesonce tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadnt been aired for many days found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside open the windows of the drawing room we sat smoking out into the darkness ought to go away said pretty certain theyll trace your car away now old sport to for a week or up to wouldnt consider it couldnt possibly leave until he knew what she was going to do was clutching at some last hope and couldnt bear to shake him free was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with it to me because had broken up like glass against hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out think that he would have acknowledged anything now without reserve but he wanted to talk about was the first nice girl he had ever known various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between found her excitingly desirable went to her house at first with other officers from then alone amazed himhe had never been in such a beautiful house before what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that lived thereit was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him was a ripe mystery about it a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this years shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered excited him too that many men had already loved increased her value in his eyes felt their presence all about the house pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions he knew that he was in house by a colossal accident glorious might be his future as he was at present a penniless young man without a past and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders he made the most of his time took what he could get ravenously and unscrupulouslyeventually he took one still night took her because he had no real right to touch her hand might have despised himself for he had certainly taken her under false pretences dont mean that he had traded on his phantom millions but he had deliberately given a sense of security he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herselfthat he was fully able to take care of her a matter of fact he had no such facilitieshe had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world he didnt despise himself and it didnt turn out as he had imagined had intended probably to take what he could and gobut now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail knew that was extraordinary but he didnt realize just how extraordinary a nice girl could be vanished into her rich house into her rich full life leaving felt married to her that was all they met again two days later it was who was breathless who was somehow betrayed porch was bright with the bought luxury of star shine the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves of the freshness of many clothes and of gleaming like silver safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor cant describe to you how surprised was to find out loved her old sport even hoped for a while that shed throw me over but she didnt because she was in love with me too thought knew a lot because knew different things from her there was way off my ambitions getting deeper in love every minute and all of a sudden didnt care was the use of doing great things if could have a better time telling her what was going to do the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with in his arms for a long silent time was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coats shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers gently as though she were asleep did extraordinarily well in the war was a captain before he went to the front and following the battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns the armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to instead was worried nowthere was a quality of nervous despair in letters didnt see why he couldnt come was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor this twilight universe began to move again with the season suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed all the time something within her was crying for a decision wanted her life shaped now immediatelyand the decision must be made by some forceof love of money of unquestionable practicalitythat was close at hand force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and was flattered there was a certain struggle and a certain relief letter reached while he was still at was dawn now on and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs filling the house with grey turning gold turning light shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves was a slow pleasant movement in the air scarcely a wind promising a cool lovely day dont think she ever loved him turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly must remember old sport she was very excited this afternoon told her those things in a way that frightened herthat made it look as if was some kind of cheap sharper the result was she hardly knew what she was saying sat down gloomily course she might have loved him just for a minute when they were first marriedand loved me more even then do you see he came out with a curious remark any case he said it was just personal could you make of that except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldnt be measured came back from when and were still on their wedding trip and made a miserable but irresistible journey to on the last of his army pay stayed there a week walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the night and revisiting the out of the way places to which they had driven in her white car as house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself even though she was gone from it was pervaded with a melancholy beauty left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found herthat he was leaving her behind day coachhe was penniless nowwas hot went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding chair and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by out into the spring fields where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street track curved and now it was going away from the sun which as it sank lower seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it the freshest and the best forever was nine oclock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air gardener the last one of former servants came to the foot of the steps going to drain the pool today start falling pretty soon and then theres always trouble with the pipes do it today answered turned to me apologetically know old sport never used that pool all summer looked at my watch and stood up minutes to my train didnt want to go to the city wasnt worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than thati didnt want to leave missed that train and then another before could get myself away call you up said finally old sport call you about noon walked slowly down the steps suppose call too looked at me anxiously as if he hoped corroborate this suppose so goodbye shook hands and started away before reached the hedge remembered something and turned around a rotten crowd shouted across the lawn worth the whole damn bunch put together always been glad said that was the only compliment ever gave him because disapproved of him from beginning to end he nodded politely and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile as if wed been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps and thought of the night when first came to his ancestral home three months before lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruptionand he had stood on those steps concealing his incorruptible dream as he waved them goodbye thanked him for his hospitality were always thanking him for thati and the others called enjoyed breakfast in the city tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock then fell asleep in my swivel chair before noon the phone woke me and started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead was she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry left house she said at and going down to this afternoon it had been tactful to leave house but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid werent so nice to me last night could it have mattered then for a moment want to see you want to see you too dont go to and come into town this afternoon dont think this afternoon well impossible this afternoon talked like that for a while and then abruptly we werent talking any longer dont know which of us hung up with a sharp click but know didnt care couldnt have talked to her across a tea table that day if never talked to her again in this world called house a few minutes later but the line was busy tried four times finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from out my timetable drew a small circle around the three fifty train leaned back in my chair and tried to think was just noon passed the ash heaps on the train that morning had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car supposed thered be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and tragic achievement was forgotten want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before had difficulty in locating the sister must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sisters body long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it someone said it was a shame and closed the door and several other men were with him first four or five men later two or three men later had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee that he stayed there alone with until dawn three oclock the quality of incoherent muttering changedhe grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen when he heard himself say this he flinched and began to cry my again in his groaning voice made a clumsy attempt to distract him long have you been married on there try and sit still a minute and answer my question long have you been married years had any children on sit stilli asked you a question you ever have any children hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadnt stopped a few hours before didnt like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the officehe knew every object in it before morningand from time to time sat down beside trying to keep him more quiet you got a church you go to sometimes even if you havent been there for a long time could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you see belong to any ought to have a church for times like this must have gone to church once you get married in a church listen to me you get married in a church was a long time ago effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rockingfor a moment he was silent the same half knowing half bewildered look came back into his faded eyes in the drawer there he said pointing at the desk drawer drawerthat one opened the drawer nearest his hand was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver was apparently new he inquired holding it up stared and nodded found it yesterday afternoon tried to tell me about it but knew it was something funny mean your wife bought it had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau didnt see anything odd in that and he gave a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash conceivably had heard some of these same explanations before from because he began saying my again in a whisperhis comforter left several explanations in the air he killed her said mouth dropped open suddenly did have a way of finding out morbid said his friend has been a strain to you and you dont know what youre saying better try and sit quiet till morning murdered her was an accident shook his head eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior know he said definitely one of these trusting fellas and dont think any harm to nobody but when get to know a thing know it was the man in that car ran out to speak to him and he wouldnt stop had seen this too but it hadnt occurred to him that there was any special significance in it believed that had been running away from her husband rather than trying to stop any particular car could she of been like that a deep one said as if that answered the question h h began to rock again and stood twisting the leash in his hand you got some friend that could telephone for was a forlorn hopehe was almost sure that had no friend there was not enough of him for his wife was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room a blue quickening by the window and realized that dawn wasnt far off five oclock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light glazed eyes turned out to the ash heaps where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind spoke to her he muttered after a long silence told her she might fool me but she couldnt fool took her to the windowwith an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against itand said knows what youve been doing everything youve been doing may fool me but you cant fool behind him saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night sees everything repeated an advertisement assured him made him turn away from the window and look back into the room stood there a long time his face close to the window pane nodding into the twilight six oclock was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together was quieter now and went home to sleep when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage was gone movementshe was on foot all the timewere afterward traced to and then to where he bought a sandwich that he didnt eat and a cup of coffee must have been tired and walking slowly for he didnt reach until noon far there was no difficulty in accounting for his timethere were boys who had seen a man acting sort of crazy and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road for three hours he disappeared from view police on the strength of what he said to that he had a way of finding out supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout inquiring for a yellow car the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward and perhaps he had an easier surer way of finding out what he wanted to know half past two he was in where he asked someone the way to house by that time he knew name two oclock put on his bathing suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up he gave instructions that the open car wasnt to be taken out under any circumstancesand this was strange because the front right fender needed repair shouldered the mattress and started for the pool he stopped and shifted it a little and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four oclockuntil long after there was anyone to give it to if it came have an idea that himself didnt believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world paid a high price for living too long with a single dream must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass new world material without being real where poor ghosts breathing dreams like air drifted fortuitously about like that ashen fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees chauffeurhe was one of protgsheard the shotsafterwards he could only say that he hadnt thought anything much about them drove from the station directly to house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone they knew then firmly believe scarcely a word said four of us the chauffeur butler gardener and hurried down to the pool was a faint barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly tracing like the leg of transit a thin red circle in the water was after we started with toward the house that the gardener saw body a little way off in the grass and the holocaust was complete two years remember the rest of that day and that night and the next day only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of front door rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered open mouthed about the pool with a positive manner perhaps a detective used the expression madman as he bent over body that afternoon and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning of those reports were a nightmaregrotesque circumstantial eager and untrue testimony at the inquest brought to light suspicions of his wife thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinadebut who might have said anything didnt say a word showed a surprising amount of character about it toolooked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen that her sister was completely happy with her husband that her sister had been into no mischief whatever convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure was reduced to a man deranged by grief in order that the case might remain in its simplest form it rested there all this part of it seemed remote and unessential found myself on side and alone the moment telephoned news of the catastrophe to village every surmise about him and every practical question was referred to me first was surprised and confused then as he lay in his house and didnt move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that was responsible because no one else was interestedinterested mean with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end called up half an hour after we found him called her instinctively and without hesitation she and had gone away early that afternoon and taken baggage with them no address when theyd be back idea where they are could reach them dont know say wanted to get somebody for him wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him get somebody for you worry trust me and get somebody for you name wasnt in the phone book butler gave me his office address on and called but by the time had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone you ring again rung three times very important afraid no ones there went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors all these official people who suddenly filled it though they drew back the sheet and looked at with shocked eyes his protest continued in my brain here old sport youve got to get somebody for me got to try hard cant go through this alone started to ask me questions but broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his deskhed never told me definitely that his parents were dead there was nothingonly the picture of a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall morning sent the butler to with a letter to which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train request seemed superfluous when wrote it was sure hed start when he saw the newspapers just as was sure thered be a wire from before noonbut neither a wire nor arrived no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men the butler brought back answer began to have a feeling of defiance of scornful solidarity between and me against them all has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me hardly can believe it that it is true at all a mad act as that man did should make us all think cannot come down now as am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now there is anything can do a little later let me know in a letter by hardly know where am when hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out truly and then hasty addenda beneath me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all the phone rang that afternoon and said was calling thought this would be at last the connection came through as a mans voice very thin and far away is speaking name was unfamiliar of a note isnt it my wire havent been any wires in trouble he said rapidly picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter got a circular from giving em the numbers just five minutes before dyou know about that hey never can tell in these hick towns interrupted breathlessly herethis isnt dead was a long silence on the other end of the wire followed by an exclamation then a quick squawk as the connection was broken think it was on the third day that a telegram signed arrived from a town in said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came was father a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm day eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that had difficulty in getting off his coat was on the point of collapse so took him into the music room and made him sit down while sent for something to eat he wouldnt eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand saw it in the newspaper he said was all in the newspaper started right away didnt know how to reach you eyes seeing nothing moved ceaselessly about the room was a madman he said must have been mad you like some coffee urged him dont want anything all right now all right now have they got took him into the drawing room where his son lay and left him there little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall when told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away a little while opened the door and came out his mouth ajar his face flushed slightly his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride helped him to a bedroom upstairs while he took off his coat and vest told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came didnt know what youd want is my name thought you might want to take the body shook his head always liked it better down rose up to his position in the you a friend of my boys were close friends had a big future before him you know was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here touched his head impressively and nodded hed of lived hed of been a great man man like of helped build up the country true said uncomfortably fumbled at the embroidered coverlet trying to take it from the bed and lay down stifflywas instantly asleep night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who was before he would give his name is said sounded relieved is was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at grave didnt want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so been calling up a few people myself were hard to find funerals tomorrow said oclock here at the house wish youd tell anybody whod be interested will he broke out hastily course not likely to see anybody but if do tone made me suspicious course youll be there yourself certainly try called up about is a minute interrupted about saying youll come the fact isthe truth of the matter is that staying with some people up here in and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow fact theres a sort of picnic or something course do my best to get away ejaculated an unrestrained and he must have heard me for he went on nervously called up about was a pair of shoes left there wonder if itd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on see theyre tennis shoes and sort of helpless without them address is care of didnt hear the rest of the name because hung up the receiver that felt a certain shame for gentleman to whom telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved that was my fault for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at on the courage of liquor and should have known better than to call him morning of the funeral went up to to see couldnt seem to reach him any other way door that pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked and at first there didnt seem to be anyone inside when shouted hello several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes in she said gone to first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle tunelessly inside say that wants to see him cant get him back from can this moment a voice unmistakably called from the other side of the door your name on the desk she said quickly give it to him when he gets back know hes there took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips young men think you can force your way in here any time she scolded getting sickantired of it say hes in hes in mentioned h looked at me over again you justwhat was your name vanished a moment stood solemnly in the doorway holding out both hands drew me into his office remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us and offered me a cigar memory goes back to when first met him he said young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldnt buy some regular clothes time saw him was when he came into poolroom at third and asked for a job hadnt eat anything for a couple of days on have some lunch with me said ate more than four dollars worth of food in half an hour you start him in business inquired him made him raised him up out of nothing right out of the gutter saw right away he was a fine appearing gentlemanly young man and when he told me he was at knew could use him good got him to join the and he used to stand high there off he did some work for a client of mine up to were so thick like that in everythinghe held up two bulbous fingersalways together wondered if this partnership had included the transaction in hes dead said after a moment were his closest friend so know youll want to come to his funeral this afternoon like to come come then hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears cant do iti cant get mixed up in it he said nothing to get mixed up in all over now a man gets killed never like to get mixed up in it in any way keep out was a young man it was differentif a friend of mine died no matter how stuck with them to the end may think thats sentimental but mean itto the bitter end saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come so stood up you a college man he inquired suddenly a moment thought he was going to suggest a gonnegtion but he only nodded and shook my hand us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead he suggested that my own rule is to let everything alone left his office the sky had turned dark and got back to in a drizzle changing my clothes went next door and found walking up and down excitedly in the hall pride in his son and in his sons possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me sent me this picture took out his wallet with trembling fingers there was a photograph of the house cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands pointed out every detail to me eagerly there and then sought admiration from my eyes had shown it so often that think it was more real to him now than the house itself sent it to me think its a very pretty picture shows up well well you seen him lately come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house live in now course we was broke up when he run off from home but see now there was a reason for it knew he had a big future in front of him ever since he made a success he was very generous with me seemed reluctant to put away the picture held it for another minute lingeringly before my eyes he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called here this is a book he had when he was a boy just shows you opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule and the date underneath from bed am exercise and wall scaling electricity etc pm and sports elocution poise and how to attain it needed inventions wasting time at or a name indecipherable more smokeing or chewing every other day one improving book or magazine per week crossed out per week better to parents came across this book by accident said the old man just shows you dont it just shows you was bound to get ahead always had some resolves like this or something you notice what hes got about improving his mind was always great for that told me et like a hog once and beat him for it was reluctant to close the book reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use little before three the minister arrived from and began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars did father as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way minister glanced several times at his watch so took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour it wasnt any use came five oclock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gatefirst a motor hearse horribly black and wet then and the minister and me in the limousine and a little later four or five servants and the postman from in station wagon all wet to the skin we started through the gate into the cemetery heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground looked around was the man with owl eyed glasses whom had found marvelling over books in the library one night three months before never seen him since then dont know how he knew about the funeral or even his name rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from grave tried to think about then for a moment but he was already too far away and could only remember without resentment that hadnt sent a message or a flower heard someone murmur are the dead that the rain falls on and then the owl eyed man said to that in a brave voice straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars eyes spoke to me by the gate couldnt get to the house he remarked could anybody else on started my they used to go there by the hundreds took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in poor son of a bitch he said of my most vivid memories is of coming back from prep school and later from college at time who went farther than would gather in the old dim at six oclock of a evening with a few friends already caught up into their own holiday gaieties to bid them a hasty goodbye remember the fur coats of the girls returning from or and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations you going to the the the and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands last the murky yellow cars of the and railroad looking cheerful as itself on the tracks beside the gate we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow our snow began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows and the dim lights of small stations moved by a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again my the wheat or the prairies or the lost towns but the thrilling returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow am part of that a little solemn with the feel of those long winters a little complacent from growing up in the house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a familys name see now that this has been a story of the after alltom and and and were all and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to life when the excited me most even when was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored sprawling swollen towns beyond the with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very oldeven then it had always for me a quality of distortion especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams see it as a night scene by a hundred houses at once conventional and grotesque crouching under a sullen overhanging sky and a lustreless moon the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress hand which dangles over the side sparkles cold with jewels the men turn in at a housethe wrong house no one knows the womans name and no one cares death the was haunted for me like that distorted beyond my eyes power of correction when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line decided to come back home was one thing to be done before left an awkward unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away saw and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair was dressed to play golf and remember thinking she looked like a good illustration her chin raised a little jauntily her hair the colour of an autumn leaf her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but pretended to be surprised just a minute wondered if wasnt making a mistake then thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye you did throw me over said suddenly threw me over on the telephone dont give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and felt a little dizzy for a while shook hands and do you remembershe addeda conversation we had once about driving a car exactly said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver met another bad driver didnt mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess thought you were rather an honest straightforward person thought it was your secret pride thirty said five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour didnt answer and half in love with her and tremendously sorry turned away afternoon late in saw was walking ahead of me along in his alert aggressive way his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference his head moving sharply here and there adapting itself to his restless eyes as slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store he saw me and walked back holding out his hand the matter you object to shaking hands with me know what think of you crazy he said quickly as hell dont know whats the matter with you inquired what did you say to that afternoon stared at me without a word and knew had guessed right about those missing hours started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm told him the truth he said came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when sent down word that we werent in he tried to force his way upstairs was crazy enough to kill me if hadnt told him who owned the car hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house broke off defiantly if did tell him fellow had it coming to him threw dust into your eyes just like he did in but he was a tough one ran over like youd run over a dog and never even stopped his car was nothing could say except the one unutterable fact that it wasnt true if you think didnt have my share of sufferinglook here when went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard sat down and cried like a baby it was awful couldnt forgive him or like him but saw that what he had done was to him entirely justified was all very careless and confused were careless people and smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made shook hands with him it seemed silly not to for felt suddenly as though were talking to a child he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklaceor perhaps only a pair of cuff buttonsrid of my provincial squeamishness forever house was still empty when leftthe grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside perhaps it was he who drove and over to the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own didnt want to hear it and avoided him when got off the train spent my nights in because those gleaming dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive night did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps didnt investigate it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didnt know that the party was over the last night with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more the white steps an obscene word scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick stood out clearly in the moonlight and erased it drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy moving glow of a ferryboat across the as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually became aware of the old island here that flowered once for sailors eyesa fresh green breast of the new world vanished trees the trees that had made way for house had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder as sat there brooding on the old unknown world thought of wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of dock had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it did not know that it was already behind him somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night believed in the green light the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us eluded us then but thats no mattertomorrow we will run faster stretch out our arms further one fine morning we beat on boats
